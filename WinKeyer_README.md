# The WinKeyer Alternate Version

Let's assume you plan to play this silly game entirely over CW.

Let's assume you have a WinKeyer (and yet, you're running Linux). You MAY be able to have the game script send
your salvo coordinates to your opponent.

And response that one of your ships was HIT... or subsequently SUNK.

Please see line # 8 and adjust which device name on your system points to your WinKeyer's COM port.

Also adjust line 14 as needed. The "/x15" means 15wpm. You might want 20wpm instead. You might want 25wpm.

Might I eventually add buttons for changing the keying speed? Yes I might.

Might I eventually add a button that halts transmission immediately and clears the buffer? Also yes, I might.

But it's also just as likely that you're only reading this because you're also a Python hobbyist, and you might want
to fork this entire repo and do very different things with it. What do I know?
